    "text": "Where are the slides?\nThere are none. I feel that slides are not optimal for learning. In class, slides can be detrimental if they are too wordy because that distracts from that the dialogue with the instructor, and I hold this very dialogue as essential. Outside of class, slides are neither helpful. Instead, a good book is much more beneficial, because in a book, there’s enough room to patiently explain in sufficient details, an endeavor which is impossible for a slide deck.\nTo underline my messages to you, dear learners, I will use some sketches on a virtual whiteboard, some interactive apps, live coding, and some (pre-prepared) diagrams. That’s a bit similar to what happens at Khan Academy. You might have noticed that many courses at Coursera follow a similar approach.\nI readily confess that this approach is novel to many learners in these days, learners who are accustomed to hundreds of Powerpoint slides. Please be open and I think you will appreciate this didactic style.\n\n\n\n\nSauer, Sebastian. 2019. Moderne Datenanalyse Mit r: Daten Einlesen, Aufbereiten, Visualisieren Und Modellieren. 1.

    "text": "3.5 What flavors are available?\nTypically, when one hears “inference” one thinks of p-values and null hypothesis testing. Those procedures are examples of the school of Frequentist statistics.\nHowever, there’s a second flavor of statistics to be mentioned here: Bayesian statistics.\n\n3.5.1 Frequentist inference\nFrequentism is not concerned about the probability of your research hypothesis.\nFrequentism is all about controling the long-term error. For illustration, suppose you are the CEO of a factory producing screws, and many of them. As the boss, you are not so much interested if a particular scree is in order (or faulty). Rather you are interested that the overall, long-term error rate of your production is low. One may add that your goal might not the minimize the long-term error, but to control it to a certain level - it may be to expensive to produce super high quality screws. Some decent, but cheap screws, might be more profitable.\n\n\n3.5.2 Bayes inference\nBayes inference is concerned about the probability of your research hypothesis.\nIt simply redestributes your beliefs based on new data (evidence) you observe:\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n  A(prior belief) --> B(new data) --> C(posterior belief)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn more detail, the posterior belief is formalized as the posterior probability. The Likelihood is the probability of the data given some hypothesis. The normalizing constant serves to give us a number between zero and one.\n\\[\\overbrace{\\Pr(\\color{blue}{H}|\\color{green}{D})}^\\text{posterior probability} = \\overbrace{Pr(\\color{blue}{H})}^\\text{prior} \\frac{\\overbrace{Pr(\\color{green}{D}|\\color{blue}{H})}^\\text{likelihood}}{\\underbrace{Pr(\\color{green}{D})}_{\\text{normalizing constant}}}\\]\nIn practice, the posterior probability of your hypothesis is, the average of your prior and the Likelihood of your data.\n\n\n\nPrior-Likelihood-Posterior"

Image source: Cfbaf, Public Domain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIf the slope for one predictor is the same for all values of the other predictor, then we say that no interaction is taking place.\n\n\nHere’s a visualization of a 3D regression plane (not line) without interaction: constant slope in one axis, see Figure ?fig-3dregr2.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.3: ?(caption)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.4: ?(caption)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.5: ?(caption)\n\n\n\n\nNote that the slope in each predictor axis equals 1, boringly. Hence the according 2D plots are boring, too, see Figure (3d-2dregr?).\nFor the sake of an example, consider this linear model:\n\\(mpg \\sim hp + disp\\)\nOr, in more regression like terms:\n\\(y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\epsilon\\), where x1 is hp and x2 is disp in the mtcars dataset.\nIn R terms:\n\nlm3d <- lm(mpg ~ hp + disp, data = mtcars)\n\nThe 3D plot is shown in Figure Figure 5.6.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.6: mpg ~ hp + disp\n\n\n\n\nHere are the two corresponding 2d (1 predictor) regression models:\n\nlm1 <- lm(mpg ~ hp, data = mtcars)\nplot(estimate_relation(lm1))\n\n\n\nlm2 <- lm(mpg ~ disp, data = mtcars)\nplot(estimate_relation(lm2))\n\n\n\n\nCheckout this post for a visually slightly more appealing 3d regression plane.\n\n\n5.3.2 Interaction\nFor interaction to happen we relax the assumption that the slope of predictor 1 must be constant for all values of predictor 2.\nIn R, we specify an interaction model like this:\n\nlm3d_interact <- lm(mpg ~ hp + disp + hp:disp, data = mtcars)\n\nThe symbol hp:disp can be read as “the interaction effect of hp and disp”.\nHere’s a visual account, see Figure Figure 5.7.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.7: mpg ~ hp + disp\n\n\n\n\nCompare Figure 5.7 and Figure 5.6.\nIn Figure 5.7 you’ll see that the lines along the Y axis are not parallel anymore. Similarly, the lines along the X axis are not parallel anymore.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIf the regression lines (indicating different values of one predictor) are not parallel, we say that an interaction effect is taking place.\n\n\nHowever, the difference or change between two adjacent values (lines) is constant. This value is the size the regression effect.\n\n\n5.3.3 Interaction made simple\nIf you find that two sophisticated, consider the following simple case.\nFirst, we mutate am to be a factor variable, in order to make things simpler (without loss of generality).\n\nmtcars2 <-\n  mtcars %>% \n  mutate(am_f = factor(am))\n\nNow we use this new variable for a simple regression model:\n\nlm_interact_simple <- lm(mpg ~ disp + am_f + disp:am_f, data = mtcars2)\n\nHere’s the plot, Figure Figure 5.8.\n\nplot(estimate_relation(lm_interact_simple))\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.8: A simple interaction model\n\n\n\n\nIn this picture, we see that the two regression lines are not parallel, and hence there is evidence of an interaction effect.\nThe interaction effect amounts to the difference in slops in Figure Figure 5.8.\nOne might be inclined to interpret Figure Figure 5.8 as an 3D image, where the one (reddish) line is in the foreground and the blueish line in the background (or vice versa, as you like). Given a 3D image (and hence 2 predictors), we are where we started further above.\nFor completeness, here are the parameters of the model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter\nCoefficient\nSE\n95% CI\nt(28)\np\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n25.16\n1.93\n(21.21, 29.10)\n13.07\n< .001\n\n\ndisp\n-0.03\n6.22e-03\n(-0.04, -0.01)\n-4.44\n< .001\n\n\nam f (1)\n7.71\n2.50\n(2.58, 12.84)\n3.08\n0.005\n\n\ndisp * am f (1)\n-0.03\n0.01\n(-0.05, -7.99e-03)\n-2.75\n0.010\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3.4 Centering variables\nThe effect of of am_f must be interpreted when disp is zero, which does not make much sense.\nTherefore it simplifies the interpretation of regression coefficients to center all input variables, by subtrating the mean value (“demeaning” or “centering”):\n\\[x' = x - \\bar{x}\\] In R, this can be achieved e.g,. in this way:\n\nmtcars3 <- \nmtcars2 %>% \n  mutate(disp_c = disp - mean(disp))\n\n\nlm_interact_simple2 <- lm(mpg ~ disp_c + am_f + disp_c:am_f, data = mtcars3)\nparameters(lm_interact_simple2)\n\nParameter         | Coefficient |       SE |         95% CI | t(28) |      p\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n(Intercept)       |       18.79 |     0.76 | [17.23, 20.36] | 24.63 | < .001\ndisp c            |       -0.03 | 6.22e-03 | [-0.04, -0.01] | -4.44 | < .001\nam f [1]          |        0.45 |     1.39 | [-2.40,  3.30] |  0.32 | 0.748 \ndisp c * am f [1] |       -0.03 |     0.01 | [-0.05, -0.01] | -2.75 | 0.010 \n\n\n\nUncertainty intervals (equal-tailed) and p-values (two-tailed) computed\n  using a Wald t-distribution approximation."

More precisely, we place the line such that the squared distances from the line to the points is minimal, see Figre Figure 4.2.\nConsider Figure Figure 4.3, from this source by Roback and Legler (2021). It visualizes not only the notorious regression line, but also sheds light on regression assumptions, particularly on the error distribution.\n\n\n\nFigure 4.3: Regression and some of its assumptions\n\n\n\n\n4.2.3 The linear model\nHere’s the canonical form of the linear model.\nConsider a model with \\(k\\) predictors:\n\\[y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\ldots + \\beta_k x_k + \\epsilon\\]\n\n\n4.2.4 Algebraic derivation\nFor the mathematical inclined, check out this derivation of the simple case regression model.
