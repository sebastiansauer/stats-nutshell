# Basics


## R Basics

Check out [chapter 1 in ModernDive](https://moderndive.com/1-getting-started.html) for an accessible introduction to getting started with R and RStudio.

Please also note that R and RStudio should be installed upfront (see also in ModernDive).



## Data import


Check out [chapter 4 in ModernDive](https://moderndive.com/4-tidy.html) on how to import data into RStudio and for some basic concepts about "tidy data".

Spoiler: There's a button in RStudio in the "Environment" Pane saying "Import Dataset". 
Just click it, and things should work out.
