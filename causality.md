## Intro to causality

Check out this [talk](https://sebastiansauer-academic.netlify.app/uploads/Intro-to-Causality.pdf).

## Literature

@rohrer_thinking_2018 provides an accessible introduction to causal inference. Slightly more advanced is the introduction by one of the leading figures of the Field, Judea Pearl, @pearl_causal_2016.
If your after a text book on modelling that covers causal inference, and if you like Bayesian statistics, than you should definitely check out @mcelreath_statistical_2020.
